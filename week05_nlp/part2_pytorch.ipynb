    "\n",
    "#### E) Optimizing seriously\n",
    "\n",
    "* You don't necessarily need 100 epochs. Use early stopping. If you've never done this before, take a look at [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/callbacks.py#L461) for inspiration.\n",
    "  * In short, train until you notice that validation\n",
    "  * Maintain the best-on-validation snapshot via `model.state_dict`\n",
